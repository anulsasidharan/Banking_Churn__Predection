# üè¶ Banking Customer Churn Prediction
#### This project aims to predict customer churn in the banking sector using Deep Learning techniques(ANN using Tensorflow). By analyzing customer behavior, transaction patterns, and demographic data, the model identifies customers who are likely to leave the bank. The objective is to help financial institutions proactively retain high-value clients and reduce attrition rates.

## üîç Key Features

### Dataset: 
- Utilizes the `Churn_Modelling.csv` dataset containing customer demographics and account details.

### Data Preprocessing:

- Encoding categorical variables using `Label Encoding` and `One-Hot Encoding`.

- Feature scaling using a pre-fitted scaler (`scaler.pkl`).

### Modeling:

- Implements an `Artificial Neural Network (ANN)` using `TensorFlow/Keras`.

- Trained model saved as `model.h5` for future predictions.

### Prediction Pipeline:

- `prediction.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the prediction process on new data.

- `app.py`: Script for deploying the model as a web application (e.g., using `Flask or Streamlit`).

### Experiments:

- `experiments.ipynb`: Contains `exploratory data analysis (EDA)` and model training experiments.
